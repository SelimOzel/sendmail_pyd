The project uses Python [3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) on Ubuntu. Use `dub run` to build it. Also run the `pyd_set_env_vars.bat python3` and make sure you map to the correct python installation on your local. Check out PyD documentation for more information. 

For some reason, it didn't work on Windows 10 and worked right out the box on Ubuntu.
